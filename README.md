# stdhu
This example showcases the HMake support for C++ header-units.
std.ixx is copied from VS-installation-dir/modules/ directory.
I commented the module related code so it only has the code for
header includes.

```hmake.cpp``` defines two configurations,
one with exceptions and one without exceptions.
